# Exercises

The folders contain exercise files for the gives topic. Usually each exercise is a separate function and the result should be returned.

### Run the exercise test

To test if your solution is correct, you can run the tests corresponding to the exercises.

#### Example

This command should be run from the root:

`npm run test ./array/array.test.js`

This command runs the test cases in the `array.test.js` in watch mode. Meaning, that if you change the `arrayExercises.js` or the `array.test.js` files the tests will be executed again.
